Imagine: **what if your TW weeks... took 1 hour?**

Minicycle is a full-day workshop during which you will have to **deliver working software every hour**. You will experience Agile development in its purest form, and see that a really short iteration cycle is possible.

**What's the project?**

We will be working on a text-mode adventure game, similar to Zork. The player can explore the game world, find items, cross obstacles or defeat monsters.

There will be starting code and a backlog of user stories, with different ideas for features to add.

**What about technology?**

Up to you. Starting code will be provided in Python, JavaScript, and Java. Remember that you will need to code quickly.

**Are we working in teams?**

Absolutely! We recommend teams of 2-3 people. Good team cooperation and pair programming is a must.

If you want to work in a bigger team, remember that merging code from 2 computers within one hour might be challenging.

**Should I participate?**

You don't have to, but you're encouraged! Just be prepared for a very intense day.
