# Guide for mentors

## What to prepare before the event?

- Whiteboard, markers, wiper
- Paper and pens
- Projector

## Schedule

- 9:20 - 9:40 intro
- 9:40 - 10 teams, initial setup, initial planning
- 10 - 11 iteration 1
- 11 - 12 iteration 2
- 12 - 13 lunch break
  - I wouldn't make it shorter, the previous 2 hours were intense
- 13 - 14 iteration 3
- 14 - 15 iteration 4
- 15 - 15:10 some time for closing

## Introduction

Project intro:
- This is an adventure game: show a quick demo
- Live-coding: show skeleton code in Python

Intro:
- "TW week in one day"
- 4 one-hour iterations - no a lot of time, so make it count
- There is project and user-stories, but you'll get a lot of freedom. You can do them in any order
- The project doesn't have to be in English
- Start iteration with planning, but don't plan too much! 5-10 minutes discussion is probably enough
- At the end of each iteration, you need to present working project. At least **1 new user story** should be presented
- When something is working, **commit**

Setup:
- Send Classroom link on Discord: https://classroom.github.com/a/LQmsYLSe
- Select your teams (2/3 people + language)
- I suggest pair programming, you can alternate or one person can code the whole time
- Download the repo + run the program now
- Then, there is some time for initial planning

## Iterations

- 50 minutes coding
  - help the students out if they are stuck
  - especially towards the end: make sure there is something to present!

- 5 minutes: presentation of changes
  - present what's new in the project
  - try to really keep all teams to 5 minutes total (this will be harder towards the end)

- 5 minutes retrospective. For example:
  - divide whiteboard into 3 parts: "Plus", "Minus", "Idea" (for the next iteration)
  - go in a circle and ask everyone about these 3 things
  - write them down

## Closing

I asked two questions:

- What did you learn?
- What would you change in the next version of workshop?

## Tips & Tricks

- If necessary, help with time management (e.g. tell them how much time remains)
- First iteration (and "Movement") is hardest, get ready to help. Later there will be more momentum
- Don't worry about lack of planning, or unclean code. Emphasize **working project**. They don't even have to present the code. Just show that the code works!
- Get them in the habit of **committing** once things work
- Pair programming is a must, even "triple programming" at the beginning
- With multiple computers, be ready to help out with Git troubles
- If something doesn't work: that's OK, they will finish it later, for now you can `git stash` and present
